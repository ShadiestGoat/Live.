## What is this?

This is intended to be an open source game. I wanted it to be a mix of the "rouge like reverse bulltet hell" like [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/) or [Magic Survival](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vkslrzm.Zombie) & an RPG like [Inflation RPG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.infurerpgkuesuto). 

TODO: Add more details

I also want it to be extremly easy to mod. In order to achieve that, right now I have most things defined in a manifest.json (resources/hell.manifest.json)
